```

### 7. **Implementation Details**

#### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Enhanced interview_questions table
CREATE TABLE public.interview_questions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    industry VARCHAR(100),
    difficulty_level INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    question_type VARCHAR(50), -- behavioral, technical, situational, system-design
    tags TEXT[], -- for filtering and search
    expected_answer_framework TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### **Component Updates:**
